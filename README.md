## Editing a deck

Each week has a lecture and a seminar deck. Sources live in `<week>/src/lecture.html` and
`<week>/src/seminar.html`; shared head, styles and script are in `<week>/src/_head.html` and
`_tail.html`, images in `src/img/` and icons in `src/icons/`. Build the self-contained decks
(images and icons inlined, slides numbered) into `<week>/lecture/` and `<week>/seminar/` with:

```
python tools/build.py w9            # both decks
python tools/build.py w9 seminar    # one deck
```

In the deck: arrow keys, Space or click to move; F full screen; O overview; S speaker notes.
